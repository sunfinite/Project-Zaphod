Hi there,
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Sunny, your classmate at PESIT. I am working on a site where we can ask/edit questions/answers(no feeling shy or stupid, ever again), start assignments or upload resources. It's basically a wiki that we can call our own. There's some other stuff under construction. Take a look: <a href = "www.projectzaphod.in" target = '_blank'>www.projectzaphod.in</a></p>  
<p>
Even though anonymity is central to the scheme of things, entries/edits are password protected to prevent misuse.
<br />
Your password for the site is: <b> passwordhere </b>   
<br />
It is strongly recommended that you change your password <a href = 'www.projectzaphod.in/changepassword/' target = '_blank'>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Project Zaphod aims to be an open source collaborative project(for our batch, at least) and needs your support both as a user and developer. If you are interested in working on the project, find some rough edges or have suggestions, just reply to this email. You can also check out the <a href = "www.projectzaphod.in/projects/1729/" target = '_blank'>project log</a> for more information.
</p> 

Thank You.
